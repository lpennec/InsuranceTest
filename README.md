# TO READ! :)
DEAR SEQUEL

Thanks for this opportunity you gave me. I wish you the best for the future and I hope to work together.

Sincerely,

Lpennec.

PS: I created a new branch called "better", this solution was created after the time was up. It is MUCH better than the one I created first... :/

PS2: I added a new test that was missing in your test. The problem in the test (willingly maybe?) is that you add the underwriters to 
the LIST always with a seq_No that is is increasing. The new test creates a new List with seqNo starting high. It is to make sure my code sorts the List of underwriters before working on it.

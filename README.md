# TO READ! :)
DEAR SEQUEL

Thanks for this opportunity you gave me. I wish you the best for the future and I hope to work together. 

Sincerely,

Lpennec.

PS: I created a new branch called "better", this solution was created after the time was up. It is MUCH better than the one I created first... :/ It also includes an additional test (seqNo in a different order).

By the way: I spent the last 3 days using Selenium driver ;).
